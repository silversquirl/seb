# Seb

Seb is an IRC bot that stores and regurgitates "factoids". These may or
may not actually be true, depending on the human and/or AI contents of
your channel.

Seb is designed to use either SQLite or PostgreSQL as its data store,
though it's possible to use a different database if it's supported by
[Sequel][sequel] and you install the relevant gem.
